## S-box

The s-box and inverse s-box can be generated by ```sbox.c```.



## AES complete implementation

All the functions needed for the realization of ***AES*** (Advanced Encryption Standard) are included in ```aes.c```. The header file ```aes.h``` contains the s-box and inverse s-box generated by ```sbox.c```, and the round constants array ```Rcon``` referred from Wikipedia.

```c
uint8_t *encode(const uint8_t message[16], const uint8_t key[16]);
uint8_t *decode(const uint8_t cipher[16], const uint8_t key[16]);
```

The above two functions are the core functions. The first one encodes the plaintext message into the corresponding ciphertext, and the second one decodes the ciphertext into the original plaintext message.

In ```main.c```, I randomly generate the plaintext and key by using the ```rand()``` function. After calling the ```encode()``` and ```decode``` functions, I finally compare the original plaintext to the one generated by decoding. The result shows that they are the same, so it's a successful implementation.

Below are some examples:

1. **Plaintext: 37afc729ad8d01d8d3c4c2f7ca7a5e6c**
   **Key: 35d827af73eb9fe146b862cacb4dfa33**
   **Ciphertext: 72591eee28df3b3675a72de02419c803**
   **Text after decoding: 37afc729ad8d01d8d3c4c2f7ca7a5e6c**
   **Successfully encoded and decoded!**

2. **Plaintext: b09d8f021e2cc34edd5da814613aaa27**
   **Key: b0beb09add4915c74bc5dd9f218e411f**
   **Ciphertext: b229b29bc60f13acbd1fb27e0b2638bb**
   **Text after decoding: b09d8f021e2cc34edd5da814613aaa27**
   **Successfully encoded and decoded!**



## Compile

The file ```Makefile``` is included in folder ```ex4```, just use the command ```make``` to get the executable file of ```sbox.c``` as ```sbox```, the executable file of ```main.c aes.c``` as ```aes```.

If the ```Makefile``` cannot be used in some cases, try to use the command ```cmake ./``` in folder ```ex4``` to regenerate the makefile.
